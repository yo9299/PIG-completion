# PIG completion solver 

This code solves the Proper Interval Graph completion problem on interval graphs with a universal node: i.e., given an interval graph with a universal node, it returns
the minimum amount of edges that we need to add to make it a unit interval graph.

Given the MPQ-tree of the interval graph as a tree object (defined in Tree.py), the function main (in main.py) computes a PIG-completion.
